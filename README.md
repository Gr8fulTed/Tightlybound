Tightlybound
============

Tightlybound. Hundreds of little communities. You join, and you get put in a section. You can only interact with people in this section. Each section consists of 200 people. Once it's full, it's full. However, people will be kicked after a month or so of inactivity and have to join a new one. A twitter-like interface, only encouraging deep discussion. In your little slice of the network.
